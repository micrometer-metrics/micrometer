Micrometer contains a core library with the instrumentation SPI and an in-memory implementation that does not export data anywhere, a series of modules with implementations for various monitoring systems, and a test module.

To use Micrometer, add the dependency for your monitoring system.

The following example adds Prometheus in Gradle:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus:latest.release'
----

The following example adds Prometheus in Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
  <version>${micrometer.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Through Micrometer's composite meter registry (described in greater detail in link:/docs/concepts#_composite_registries["Concepts"]), you may configure more than one registry implementation if you intend to publish metrics to more than one monitoring system.

If you have not decided on a monitoring system yet and want only to try out the instrumentation SPI, you can add a dependency on `micrometer-core` instead and configure the `SimpleMeterRegistry`.

== Snapshots

Every successful https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/micrometer-metrics/micrometer[build] of Micrometer's `main` and maintenance branches (for example, `1.7.x`) results in the publication of a new snapshot version. You can use the latest snapshot by adding the Maven repository `https://repo.spring.io/snapshot` to your build and using the corresponding snapshot version -- for example, `1.8.0-SNAPSHOT`.

== Milestones

Milestone releases are made available for early testing purposes and are not intended for production use.
Milestone releases are published to https://repo.spring.io/milestone.
Include that as a Maven repository in your build configuration to use milestone releases.
Milestones are marked as "`pre-releases`" on GitHub, and the version has a suffix, such as `-M1` or `-RC1` (milestone 1 or release candidate 1, respectively).
