OpenTelemetry is a CNCF incubating project for providing standards for telemetry data. OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) is a vendor-neutral protocol that you can use to send data to various backends that support it. You can read the corresponding docs on how the metrics are ingested and can be visualized in the respective vendor docs.

== Configuring
The following example configures an OTLP registry:

[source,java]
----
OtlpConfig otlpConfig = new OtlpConfig() {
            @Override
            public String get(final String key) {
                return null;
            }
};

MeterRegistry registry = new OtlpMeterRegistry(otlpConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

`OtlpConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source (for example, a simple `Map` can work), you can override the default configuration through properties. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.otlp.metrics.export` directly to the `OtlpConfig`:

[source, yaml]
----
management:
  otlp:
    metrics:
      export:
        # Supported configs
        url: "https://otlp.example.com:4318/v1/metrics"
        aggregationTemporality: "cumulative"
        headers:
          header1: value1
        step: 30s
        resourceAttributes:
          key1: value1
----

1. `url` - The URL to which data is reported. Environment variables `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` are also supported in the default implementation. If a value is not provided, it defaults to `http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics`
2. `aggregationTemporality` - https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#temporality[Aggregation temporality, window=_blank] determines how the additive quantities are expressed, in relation to time. The environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE` is supported by the default implementation. The supported values are `cumulative` or `delta`. Defaults to `cumulative`.
3. `headers` - Additional headers to send with exported metrics. This can be used for authorization headers. By default, headers are loaded from the config. If that is not set, they can be taken from the environment variables `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS`. If a header is set in both the environmental variables, the header in the latter overrides the former.
4. `step` - the interval at which metrics will be published. The environment variable `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` is supported by the default implementation. If a value is not provided, defaults to 1 minute.
5. `resourceAttributes` - https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/resource/semantic_conventions/#service[Resource attributes, window=_blank] are used for all metrics published. By default, Micrometer adds the following resource attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Key | Default value

|telemetry.sdk.name
|io.micrometer

|telemetry.sdk.language
|java

|telemetry.sdk.version
|<micrometer-core-version> (e.g.: 1.11.0)

|service.name
|unknown_service
|===

If this config is empty, resource attributes are loaded from the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environmental variable. You can override `service.name` by setting the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environmental variable, and this takes precedence over other configs.

== Supported metrics
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#metric-points[Metric points, window=_blank] define the different data points that are supported in OTLP. Micrometer supports exporting the below data points in OTLP format,

1. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#sums[Sums, window=_blank]
2. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#gauge[Gauge, window=_blank]
3. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#histogram[Histogram, window=_blank]
4. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram[Exponential Histogram, window=_blank]
5. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#summary-legacy[Summary, window=_blank]

The following table maps OTLP data points and the Micrometer meters:

[%autowidth]
|===
|OTLP data point | Micrometer meter type

|Sums
|Counter, FunctionCounter

|Gauge
|Gauge, TimeGauge, MultiGauge

|Histogram/Exponential Histogram^*^
|Timer, DistributionSummary, LongTaskTimer, FunctionTimer (only sum and count are set)

|Summary
|Timer, DistributionSummary, LongTaskTimer
|===
__* - Histogram or Exponential Histogram is determined based on the configuration of the `OtlpMeterRegistry`. See below section for more info.__

*Note*:

1. `max` on the Histogram data point is supported only in delta aggregation temporality. This is because the values represented by cumulative min and max stabilize as more events are recorded and are less useful when recorded over application's lifecycle.
2. Currently, Micrometer only exports metadata for type `Meter` to OTLP.

== Histograms and Percentiles
Micrometer `Timer` and `DistributionSummary` support configuring xref:/concepts/histogram-quantiles.adoc[client-side percentiles and percentile histograms]. The OTLP specification terms the Summary data point (client-side percentiles) as legacy and not recommended for new applications. The Summary data point also cannot have min/max associated with it. Due to these reasons, Micrometer prefers exporting Timers and DistributionSummary as a Histogram data point. By default, a Timer/DistributionSummary without any additional percentile/histogram config is exported as a Histogram data point. However, by configuring the timer to generate only client-side percentiles, by using `publishPercentiles`, you can change this to a Summary data point that exports pre-calculated percentiles. When both `publishPercentiles` and (`publishPercentileHistogram` or `serviceLevelObjectives`) are configured, the Histogram data point is preferred and pre-calculated percentiles are *not* generated. The following table describes which data point is used with different configurations:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Configuration | OTLP data point

| publishPercentiles
| Summary

| publishPercentileHistogram
| Histogram/Exponential Histogram ^*^

| serviceLevelObjectives
| Histogram

| publishPercentiles and (publishPercentileHistogram/serviceLevelObjectives)
| Histogram
|===
__* The configuration `histogramFlavor` determines whether the OTLP DataPoint is a Histogram/Exponential Histogram.__

`OtlpMeterRegistry` supports 2 types of Histogram implementations (1.Explicit Bucket Histogram (or simply called Histogram), 2. Exponential Histogram) when `publishPercentileHistogram` is configured. The choice is chosen by setting `histogramFlavor` in `OtlpConfig` used by registry. When the implementation is exponential histogram, it also supports 2 additional properties

1. maxScale used to cap the maximum https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponential-scale[scale, window=_blank] used by the Exponential Histogram (defaults to 20).
2. maxBuckets determines the maximum number of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponential-buckets[buckets, window=_blank] to be used for exponential histograms (defaults to 160).

Since Exponential Histogram cannot have custom SLO's specified, explicit bucket histogram is used whenever `serviceLevelObjectives` are added.

===  Configuration with Spring Boot
If you use Spring Boot, you can use the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#actuator.metrics.customizing.per-meter-properties[per-meter properties, window=_blank] to configure this behavior.

If you want to generate a Histogram data point for a Timer with name `test.timer` and default buckets generated by Micrometer, use:

[source,properties]
----
management.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.test.timer=true
----

For buckets with customized SLO, use:

[source,properties]
----
management.metrics.distribution.slo.test.timer=10.0,100.0,500.0,1000.0
----

Alternatively, if you want to generate Summary data point for a timer with name `test.timer` and 90th and 99th percentiles, you can use:

[source,properties]
----
management.metrics.distribution.percentiles.test.timer=0.9,0.99
----
