Instana is an automatic application performance management and infrastructure monitoring system.

== Installation and Configuration

Instana automatically detects and reports all metrics without the need of any additional dependency or configuration.
It does so by detecting all instances of `io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry` and collecting all registered `io.micrometer.core.instrument.Meter` instances from them.

You can run the Instana agent alongside your application by using Micrometer, and the Instana agent automatically monitors it.

== Supported Metrics

* **Timer**: The total time of recorded events, scaled to milliseconds.
* **Counter**: The cumulative count since this counter was created.
* **Gauge**: The current value.
* **DistributionSummary**: The total number of all recorded events.
* **LongTaskTimer**: The current number of tasks being executed.
* **FunctionCounter**: The cumulative count since this counter was created.
* **FunctionTimer**: The total time of all occurrences of the timed event.
* **TimeGauge**: The current value, scaled to the appropriate base unit.

The metrics show up on the Java Virtual Machine dashboard in Instana. You can configure alerting based on these metrics.
