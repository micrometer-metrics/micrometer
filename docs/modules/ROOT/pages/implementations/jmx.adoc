= Micrometer JMX
:sectnums:
:system: jmx

Micrometer provides a hierarchical mapping to JMX, primarily as a cheap and portable way to view metrics locally. Where JMX exporting is found in production, the same metrics are generally exported to another, more purpose-fit monitoring system.

Micrometer also sometimes scrapes data from JMX beans for use in reporting metrics. This registry implementation is not needed for these uses. Rather, this module is strictly used to _export_ data to JMX.

== Counters

JMX counters measure mean throughput and one-, five-, and fifteen-minute exponentially-weighted moving average throughputs.
