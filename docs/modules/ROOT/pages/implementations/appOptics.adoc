== Configuring

The following example configures an AppOptics instance:

[source,java]
----
AppOpticsConfig appopticsConfig = new AppOpticsConfig() {
    @Override
    public String apiToken() {
        return MY_TOKEN;
    }

    @Override
    @Nullable
    public String get(String k) {
        return null;
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new AppOpticsMeterRegistry(appopticsConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

`AppOpticsConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties that are prefixed with `management.metrics.export.appoptics` directly to the `AppOpticsConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.appoptics:
    api-token: YOURKEY

    # You will probably want disable AppOptics publishing in a local development profile.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to AppOptics. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m
----

== Graphing

This section serves as a quick start to rendering useful representations in AppOptics for metrics that originate in Micrometer.

=== Timers

The AppOptics implementation of `Timer` produces three fields in AppOptics:

* `sum`: Rate of calls per second.
* `count`: Rate of total time per second.
* `max`: A sliding window maximum amount recorded.

AppOptics performs the `sum/count` division dimensionally to generate aggregable averages on your behalf.
