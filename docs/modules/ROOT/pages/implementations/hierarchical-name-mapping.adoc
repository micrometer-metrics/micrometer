== Hierarchical name mapping

Micrometer provides a `HierarchicalNameMapper` interface that governs how a dimensional meter ID is mapped to flat hierarchical names.

The default (`HierarchicalNameMapper.DEFAULT`) sorts tags alphabetically by key and appends tag key/value pairs to the base meter name with '.' -- for example, `http_server_requests.method.GET.response.200`. The name and tag keys have the registry's naming convention applied to them first.

If there is something special about your naming scheme that you need to honor, you can provide your own `HierarchicalNameMapper` implementation. The most common cause of a custom mapper comes from a need to prefix something to the front of every metric (generally something like `app.<name>.http_server_requests.method.GET.response.200`).
