Stackdriver Monitoring is a dimensional time-series SaaS with built-in dashboarding.

== Configuring

The following example configures Stackdriver:

[source,java]
----
StackdriverConfig stackdriverConfig = new StackdriverConfig() {
    @Override
    public String projectId() {
        return MY_PROJECT_ID;
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String key) {
        return null;
    }
}

MeterRegistry registry = StackdriverMeterRegistry.builder(stackdriverConfig).build();
----

`StackdriverConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties that are prefixed with `management.metrics.export.stackdriver` directly to the `StackdriverConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.stackdriver:
    project-id: MY_PROJECT_ID
    resource-type: global

    # You will probably want to disable Stackdriver Monitoring publishing in a local development profile.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Stackdriver Monitoring. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m
----

For most environments, you need to create and configure credentials to push metrics to Stackdriver Monitoring.
In most cases, you should create a service account with Stackdriver Monitoring permissions and configure a
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environmental variable to the path of the service account key file.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source]
----
export PROJECT_ID=MY_PROJECT_ID
export APP_NAME=MY_APP

# Create a service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create $APP_NAME

# Grant the service account Stackdriver Monitoring writer permission
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
  --member serviceAccount:$APP_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/monitoring.metricWriter

# Create a key JSON file
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $HOME/$APP_NAME-key.json \
  --iam-account $APP_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# Configure GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/$APP_NAME-key.json
----

When running in managed environments (such as Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run, Google Cloud Function)
you need not configure this environmental variable. In those environments, a service account is
automatically associated with the application instance. The underlying Stackdriver Monitoring client
library can automatically detect and use those credentials.

== Stackdriver Labels

Micrometer metrics tags are mapped to https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/metrics-details#intro-time-series[Stackdriver metrics labels]. With tags and labels, you can further filter or group
by the tag or label. See link:/docs/concepts#_tag_naming[Micrometer Concepts] for more information on tags.
The following example filters by tags:

[source,java]
----
MeterRegistry registry = StackdriverMeterRegistry.builder(stackdriverConfig).build();
registry.config().commonTags("application", "my-application");
----

You can also configure resource labels with the `StackdriverConfig` method `resourceLabels`. Depending on the configured `resourceType`, there will be required resource labels. See the documentation on https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/creating-metrics#which-resource[choosing a monitored resource type].

IMPORTANT: When using Micrometer across multiple applications/instances, it is necessary that Stackdriver labels are unique per application/instance. Otherwise, you will see errors like `One or more TimeSeries could not be written: One or more points were written more frequently than the maximum sampling period configured`. If using a resource type other than `global`, the resource labels may already make metrics unique per application instance. If not, a common tag with the hostname or platform-provided instance ID may be a good candidate for achieving this.

== Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides auto-configuration for Micrometer's StackdriverMeterRegistry. For more information, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics-export-stackdriver[Spring Boot documentation].

You can manually configure or register the `StackdriverMeterRegistry`.
In addition to using Spring Boot Actuator, make sure you create the `StackdriverMeterRegistry` bean:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
StackdriverConfig stackdriverConfig() {
    return new StackdriverConfig() {
        @Override
        public String projectId() {
            return MY_PROJECT_ID;
        }

        @Override
        public String get(String key) {
            return null;
        }
    }
}

@Bean
StackdriverMeterRegistry meterRegistry(StackdriverConfig stackdriverConfig) {
    return StackdriverMeterRegistry.builder(stackdriverConfig).build();
}
----

You can also use https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-common-tags[Spring Boot Actuator Common Tags configuration] to configure common tags:

[source]
----
spring.application.name=my-application
management.metrics.tags.application=${spring.application.name}
----

== GraalVM native image compilation

To compile an application using `micrometer-registry-stackdriver` to a https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[native image using GraalVM], add the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/native-image-support-java[native-image-support-java] library as a dependency. This will ensure the correct native image configuration is available and avoid errors like `Classes that should be initialized at run time got initialized during image building`.
