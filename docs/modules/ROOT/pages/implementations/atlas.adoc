:sectnums:
:system: atlas

Atlas is an in-memory dimensional time series database with built-in graphing, a custom stack-based query language, and advanced math operations. Atlas originated at Netflix, where it remains the operational metrics solution.

== Configuring

[source,java]
----
AtlasConfig atlasConfig = new AtlasConfig() {
    @Override
    public Duration step() {
        return Duration.ofSeconds(10);
    }

    @Override
    public String get(String k) {
        return null; // accept the rest of the defaults
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new AtlasMeterRegistry(atlasConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

Micrometer uses Netflix's https://github.com/netflix/spectator[Spectator] as the underlying instrumentation library when recording metrics destined for Atlas. `AtlasConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties prefixed with `management.metrics.export.atlas` directly to the `AtlasConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.atlas:
    # The location of your Atlas server
    uri: http://localhost:7101/api/v1/publish

    # You will probably want to conditionally disable Atlas publishing in local development.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Atlas. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

== Graphing

This section serves as a quick start to rendering useful representations in Atlas for metrics originating in Micrometer. See the https://github.com/netflix/atlas/wiki[Atlas wiki] for a far more complete reference of what is possible in Atlas.

=== Counters

Atlas serves up graphs in the form of PNG images (and other https://github.com/Netflix/atlas/wiki/Output-Formats[output formats] as well).

We use the following query to visualize the counter from Atlas. Note that the value is rate-normalized over the step interval rather than monotonically increasing. Atlas always expects xref:/concepts/rate-aggregation.adoc#_client_side[rate-aggregated] data for counters from Micrometer.

----
<1> The range of time we want to visualize along the x-axis. `e` represents the end time or "`now`". This graph's axis is from 15 minutes ago until now. Atlas automatically chooses the finest grained step interval available from the data that would render at least 1px wide on the resultant image.
<2> The overall width of the PNG image returned should be 400px.
<3> Set the y-axis lower limit to 0 so that random perturbation in the walk does not look so dramatic.

=== Timers

While reading directly from a `Timer` returns a `double`, the underlying value is
stored in https://github.com/netflix/spectator[Spectator] as a nanosecond-precise `long`. What precision is lost by
converting to a `double` in the `Timer` interface does not affect a system like
Atlas, because it has been configured to read measurements from the underlying
Spectator `Timer` that Micrometer is hiding from you.

The Spectator Atlas `Timer` produces four time series, each with a different `statistic` tag:

* `count`: Rate of calls per second.
* `totalTime`: Rate of total time per second.
* `totalOfSquares`: Rate of total time squared per second (useful for standard deviation).
* `max`: The maximum amount recorded.

Therefore, you can achieve a throughput (requests/second) line with the following query:

```http
name,timer,:eq,statistic,count,:eq,:and
```

Notice that `statistic` is just a dimension that can be drilled down and selected like any other.

Furthermore, `totalTime/count` represents average latency and can be selected with a short-hand `:dist-avg` query, which selects the `totalTime` and `count` time series and performs the division for us:

```http
name,timer,:eq,:dist-avg
```

In the preceding example, you can see these two lines plotted on a single dual-axis graph.

=== Long Task Timers

Suppose we had a task that took two minutes to complete when it was expected to complete in less than 70 seconds. A key benefit of long task timers is the ability to receive an alert at the first reporting interval after we have exceeded the threshold. With a regular timer, we would not receive an alert until the first reporting interval after the process completed. If we had a ten-second publishing interval, the regular timer alert would arrive almost a minute after the long task timer alert.

<2> A vertical span that appears whenever the long task exceeds our threshold of 70 seconds. So that it does not overwhelm the graph, we also decrease the opacity of the vspan.
<3> Plot the threshold of 70 seconds as a separate line.
