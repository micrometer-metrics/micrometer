Elasticsearch is an open source search and analytics platform. Metrics stored in Elasticsearch can be visualized in Kibana.

== Configuring

The following example configures an ElasticSearch instance:

[source,java]
----
ElasticConfig elasticConfig = new ElasticConfig() {
    @Override
    @Nullable
    public String get(String k) {
        return null;
    }
};
MeterRegistry registry = new ElasticMeterRegistry(elasticConfig, Clock.SYSTEM);
----

`ElasticConfig` is an interface with a set of default methods. If, in the implementation of `get(String k)`, rather than returning `null`, you instead bind it to a property source, you can override the default configuration. For example, Micrometer's Spring Boot support binds properties that are prefixed with `management.metrics.export.elastic` directly to the `ElasticConfig`:

[source,yml]
----
management.metrics.export.elastic:
    # You will probably want disable Elastic publishing in a local development profile.
    enabled: true

    # The interval at which metrics are sent to Elastic. The default is 1 minute.
    step: 1m

    # The index to store metrics in, defaults to "micrometer-metrics"
    index: micrometer-metrics
----

== Elastic APM agent integration

If you are using the Elastic APM agent, it can collect metrics from Micrometer `MeterRegistry` instances automatically. You can use the `SimpleMeterRegistry` if you only want metrics collected by the Elastic APM agent and not shipped anywhere else. See the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/metrics.html#metrics-micrometer[Elastic docs] for more details.
