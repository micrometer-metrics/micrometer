Micrometer's open source support policy is defined as follows for different types of releases. Release versions follow a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention, as defined in https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

* *Major release lines* (such as 1.x or 2.x) are supported with patch releases for a minimum of 3 years from the date the major release (such as `1.0.0` or `2.0.0`) was made available for download.
* *Minor release lines* (such as 1.1.x or 1.2.x) are supported with patch releases for a minimum of 12 months from the date the minor release (such as `1.1.0` or `1.2.0`) was made available for download.
* Any confirmed security vulnerabilities on supported release lines should result in a patch release to Maven Central.

Commercial support that extends beyond the OSS support period described on this page is https://tanzu.vmware.com/spring-runtime[available from VMware].

We generally plan to release a new major or minor version every 6 months (in May and November).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how the support policy applies:

** Micrometer 1.0.0 was released in February 2018. At a minimum, support for the 1.x line extends through February 2021 (Major Releases statement). Practically, the Micrometer 1.x line is supported for at least as long as Spring Boot 2.x and major versions of other dependent web frameworks are supported.
** Micrometer 1.1.0 was released in October 2018, minimally extending support through October 2019 (Minor Releases statement). Practically, the Micrometer 1.1.x line is supported for at least as long as the Spring Boot 2.1.x line is supported.
** If Micrometer 1.2.x were to be released, support for the 1.x line would be extended another 12 months from the 1.2.x release date.
** Patch releases, such as Micrometer 1.0.7, do not increase the support obligations for the 1.0.x release line.
