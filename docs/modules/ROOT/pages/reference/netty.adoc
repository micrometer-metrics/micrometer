= Netty Instrumentation

Micrometer supports binding metrics to Netty.

You can collect metrics from `ByteBuf` allocators and from `EventLoopGroup` instances.
If you already know the resources, you can create instrumentation only once at startup:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/netty/NettyMetricsTests.java[tags=directInstrumentation,indent=0]
-----

Netty infrastructure can be configured in many ways, so you can also instrument lazily at runtime, as resources are used.
The following example shows how to lazily create instrumentation:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/netty/NettyMetricsTests.java[tags=channelInstrumentation,indent=0]
-----

CAUTION: If you use lazy instrumentation, you must ensure that you do not bind metrics for the same resource multiple times, as this can have runtime drawbacks.
