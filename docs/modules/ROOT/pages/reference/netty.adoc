Micrometer supports binding metrics to `Netty`.

You can collect metrics from `ByteBuf` allocators and from `EventLoopGroup` instances.
Instrumentation can be done once at startup, if resources are already known:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/netty/NettyMetricsTests.java[tags=directInstrumentation,indent=0]
-----

Netty infrastructure can be configured in many ways, so you can also instrument lazily at runtime as resources are used.
If you do so, you must ensure that you will not bind metrics for the same resource multiple times as this can have runtime drawbacks:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/netty/NettyMetricsTests.java[tags=channelInstrumentation,indent=0]
