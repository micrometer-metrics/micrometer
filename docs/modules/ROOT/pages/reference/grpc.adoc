= gRPC Instrumentation

https://grpc.io/[gRPC] is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment.

Below you can find an example of how to instrument gRPC with Micrometer.

First, client and server side interceptors need to be setup.

// Setting up interceptors
include::{include-core-test-java}/io/micrometer/core/instrument/binder/grpc/GrpcObservationTest.java[tags=setup, indent=0]

include::{include-core-test-java}/io/micrometer/core/instrument/binder/grpc/GrpcObservationTest.java[tags=setup_2, indent=0]

Next, server and channels need to have the interceptors added.

// Adding them to the server and client side

Below you have an example of usage with the result assertions.
