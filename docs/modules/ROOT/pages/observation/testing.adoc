Micrometer Observation comes with `micrometer-observation-test` module that allows you to unit-test your Observations.

-----

The following example shows the required dependency in Maven (assuming that Micrometer BOM has been added):

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]

== Running Observation Unit Tests

Let's say that you have the following production code. It will create an observation with 2 tags (low and high cardinality) and then call `observe` that will start the observation, put it in scope, close the scope and stop the observation.

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/observation/ObservationTestingTests.java[tags=example,indent=0]
-----

To unit-test this code you can use the `TestObservationRegistry` class.

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/observation/ObservationTestingTests.java[tags=test,indent=0]
