== Installing

The following example shows the required dependency in Gradle (assuming that the Micrometer BOM has been added):

[source,groovy,subs=+attributes]
-----
testImplementation 'io.micrometer:micrometer-observation-test'
-----

The following example shows the required dependency in Maven (assuming that the Micrometer BOM has been added):

[source,xml,subs=+attributes]
-----

== Running Observation Unit Tests

Suppose you have the following production code. It will create an observation with two tags (low and high cardinality) and then call `observe` to start the observation, put it in scope, close the scope, and stop the observation:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/observation/ObservationTestingTests.java[tags=example,indent=0]
-----

To unit-test this code, you can use the `TestObservationRegistry` class:

[source,java,subs=+attributes]
-----
include::{include-java}/observation/ObservationTestingTests.java[tags=test,indent=0]
-----
