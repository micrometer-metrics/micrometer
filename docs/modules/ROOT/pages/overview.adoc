:docinfo1:

Micrometer provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular observability systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in.
Think SLF4J, but for application observability! Data recorded by Micrometer are intended to be used to observe, alert, and react to the current/recent operational state of your environment.
