= Gauges

A gauge is a handle to get the current value. Typical examples for gauges would be the size of a collection or map or number of threads in a running state.

TIP: Gauges are useful for monitoring things with natural upper bounds. We do not recommend using a gauge to monitor things like request count, as they can grow without bound for the duration of an application instance's life.

TIP: Never gauge something you can count with a `Counter`!

Micrometer takes the stance that gauges should be sampled and not be set, so there is no information about what might have occurred between samples. Any intermediate values set on a gauge are lost by the time the gauge value is reported to a metrics backend, so there is little value in setting those intermediate values in the first place.

Think of a `Gauge` as a "`heisen-gauge`": a meter that changes only when it is observed. Every other meter type accumulates intermediate counts toward the point where the data is sent to the metrics backend.

The `MeterRegistry` interface contains methods for building gauges to observe numeric values, functions, collections, and maps:

[source, java]
----
List<String> list = registry.gauge("listGauge", Collections.emptyList(), new ArrayList<>(), List::size); <1>
List<String> list2 = registry.gaugeCollectionSize("listSize2", Tags.empty(), new ArrayList<>()); <2>
Map<String, Integer> map = registry.gaugeMapSize("mapGauge", Tags.empty(), new HashMap<>());
----
<1> A slightly more common form of gauge is one that monitors some non-numeric object. The last argument establishes the function that is used to determine the value of the gauge when the gauge is observed.
<2> A more convenient form of (1) for when you want to monitor collection size.

All of the different forms of creating a gauge maintain only a _weak reference_ to the object being observed, so as not to prevent garbage collection of the object.

== Manually Incrementing or Decrementing a Gauge

A gauge can be made to track any `java.lang.Number` subtype that is settable, such as `AtomicInteger` and `AtomicLong` found in `java.util.concurrent.atomic` and similar types, such as Guava's `AtomicDouble`:

[source,java]
----
// maintain a reference to myGauge
AtomicInteger myGauge = registry.gauge("numberGauge", new AtomicInteger(0));

// ... elsewhere you can update the value it holds using the object reference
myGauge.set(27);
myGauge.set(11);
----

Note that, in this form, unlike other meter types, you do not get a reference to the `Gauge` when creating one. Rather, you get a reference to the thing being observed. This is because of the "`heisen-gauge`" principal: The gauge is self-sufficient once created, so you should never need to interact with it. This lets us give you back only the instrumented object, which allows for quick one-liners that both create the object to be observed and set up metrics around it.

This pattern should be less common than the `DoubleFunction` form. Remember that frequent setting of the observed `Number` results in a lot of intermediate values that never get published. Only the _instantaneous value_ of the gauge at publish time is ever sent to the monitoring system.

WARNING: Attempting to construct a gauge with a primitive number or one of its `java.lang` object forms is always incorrect. These numbers are immutable. Thus, the gauge cannot ever be changed. Attempting to "`re-register`" the gauge with a different number does not work, as the registry maintains only one meter for each unique combination of name and tags.

== Gauge Fluent Builder

The interface contains a fluent builder for gauges:

[source, java]
----
Gauge gauge = Gauge
    .builder("gauge", myObj, myObj::gaugeValue)
    .description("a description of what this gauge does") // optional
    .tags("region", "test") // optional
    .register(registry);
----

Generally the returned `Gauge` instance is not useful except in testing, as the gauge is already set up to track a value automatically upon registration.

== Why is My Gauge Reporting NaN or Disappearing?

It is your responsibility to hold a strong reference to the state object that you are measuring with a `Gauge`. Micrometer is careful to not create strong references to objects that would otherwise be garbage collected. Once the object being gauged is de-referenced and is garbage collected, Micrometer starts reporting a NaN or nothing for a gauge, depending on the registry implementation.

If you see your gauge reporting for a few minutes and then disappearing or reporting NaN, it almost certainly suggests that the underlying object being gauged has been garbage collected.

== `TimeGauge`

`TimeGauge` is a specialized gauge that tracks a time value, to be scaled to the base unit of time expected by each registry implementation.

`TimeGauge` can be registered with `TimeUnit` as follows:

[source, java]
----
AtomicInteger msTimeGauge = new AtomicInteger(4000);
AtomicInteger usTimeGauge = new AtomicInteger(4000);
TimeGauge.builder("my.gauge", msTimeGauge, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, AtomicInteger::get).register(registry);
TimeGauge.builder("my.other.gauge", usTimeGauge, TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS, AtomicInteger::get).register(registry);
----

And for example, if the registry is Prometheus, they will be converted in seconds as follows:

```
# HELP my_gauge_seconds
# TYPE my_gauge_seconds gauge
my_gauge_seconds 4.0
# HELP my_other_gauge_seconds
# TYPE my_other_gauge_seconds gauge
my_other_gauge_seconds 0.004
```

== Multi-gauge

Micrometer supports one last special type of `Gauge`, called a `MultiGauge`, to help manage gauging a growing or shrinking list of criteria.
This feature lets you select a set of well-bounded but slightly changing set of criteria from something like an SQL query and report some metric for each row as a `Gauge`. The following example creates a `MultiGauge`:

[source, java]
----
// SELECT count(*) from job group by status WHERE job = 'dirty'
MultiGauge statuses = MultiGauge.builder("statuses")
    .tag("job", "dirty")
    .description("The number of widgets in various statuses")
    .baseUnit("widgets")
    .register(registry);

...

// run this periodically whenever you re-run your query
statuses.register(
    resultSet.stream()
        .map(result -> Row.of(Tags.of("status", result.getAsString("status")), result.getAsInt("count")))
        .collect(toList())
);
